# SWM

swm is a minimalist stacking window manager, using prefix key style, Ã  la ratpoison and stumpwm. 

This project is a fork of dwm, which was created by see LICENSE file.

Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (swm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install swm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

If you are going to use the default bluegray color scheme it is highly
recommended to also install the bluegray files shipped in the dextra package.


Running swm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec swm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec swm

(This will start swm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec swm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of swm is done by creating a custom conf.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
